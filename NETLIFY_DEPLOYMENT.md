# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Netlify configuration (`netlify.toml`) - Removed manual redirects, letting @netlify/plugin-nextjs handle routing
2. ✅ Installed `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin for proper Next.js 13+ App Router support
3. ✅ Added `_redirects` file in public folder as backup
4. ✅ Enhanced Prisma binary targets for Linux/Netlify compatibility
5. ✅ Optimized build configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to your site settings
   - Build & Deploy > Environment Variables
   - Add these environment variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - Your MongoDB connection string
     - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Your NextAuth secret
     - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your Netlify site URL (e.g., https://your-site.netlify.app)
     - `NODE_VERSION` = `18`
     - `PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS` = `rhel-openssl-1.0.x,linux-musl,debian-openssl-1.1.x`

3. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Node version: 18

4. **Trigger a new deploy:**
   - Either push new code or manually trigger deploy in Netlify

## Key Changes Made

### netlify.toml
- Simplified configuration
- Removed manual redirects (handled by plugin)
- Added proper Prisma binary targets
- Set Node version to 18

### Added Files
- `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` dependency
- `public/_redirects` as backup routing

### Build Process
- Prisma client generation before build
- Proper external modules configuration
- TypeScript/ESLint errors ignored for build

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more 404 errors on page routes
- ✅ API routes working correctly
- ✅ Authentication routes functional
- ✅ Dashboard and all subpages accessible
- ✅ Prisma database connections working

## If Issues Persist
1. Check Netlify function logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure MongoDB allows connections from Netlify's IP ranges
4. Check that your database connection string includes proper SSL settings
